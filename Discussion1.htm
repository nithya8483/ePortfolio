<h1>Discussion 1: Impact of information system failure</h1>

<p>The National Health Service (NHS) that provides health and social care in the UK are digitialised and store patient health records that can be assessed through the Information system. The information system comprises of computer hardware and software, databases, network and human resources. This system helps the business to be efficient in terms of accessing patient health records and efficient communication across multi-disciplinary team for better decision making, in terms of reduced cost in storing data, thereby providing better customer service. 
While the success of information system has witnessed increased productivity and enhanced business operations, the failure has significant impact on several fronts. Failure in information system in the NHS hospitals in Manchester had been declared as a critical incident as the failure had resulted in series of events such as delays and disruptions to patient services causing long patient waiting times, the management lost its reputation and had to apologise for the situation (Grananda, 2022). Also the clinical team had to turn to contingency plans that had resulted in increased time and cost for the services.
The main reasons for failure in information system are incompetent leadership setting unclear goals, poor project management, selection of team members and infrastructure, lack of technical competence and unmaintained hardware. A poor management of National Information system programme for NHS had to be abandoned and resulted in about £10 billion loss of public money (Rajeev Syal, 2013).
Another important issue is the protection from personal data breaches. As per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data breaches affect the rights and freedoms of an individual and data protection is a legal requirement. Failure in IT system makes data protection vulnerable and may lead to personal sensitive information being stolen, loss of public trust on the company and eventually lead to criminal proceedings (Claudia Glover, 2022).
