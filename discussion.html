										<h1>Discussion 1: Impact of information system failure</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The National Health Service (NHS) that provides health and social care in the UK are digitialised and store patient health records that can be assessed through the Information system. The information system comprises of computer hardware and software, databases, network and human resources. This system helps the business to be efficient in terms of accessing patient health records and efficient communication across multi-disciplinary team for better decision making, in terms of reduced cost in storing data, thereby providing better customer service.</p>
									<p>While the success of information system has witnessed increased productivity and enhanced business operations, the failure has significant impact on several fronts. Failure in information system in the NHS hospitals in Manchester had been declared as a critical incident as the failure had resulted in series of events such as delays and disruptions to patient services causing long patient waiting times, the management lost its reputation and had to apologise for the situation (Grananda, 2022). Also the clinical team had to turn to contingency plans that had resulted in increased time and cost for the services.</p>
									<p>The main reasons for failure in information system are incompetent leadership setting unclear goals, poor project management, selection of team members and infrastructure, lack of technical competence and unmaintained hardware. A poor management of National Information system programme for NHS had to be abandoned and resulted in about £10 billion loss of public money (Rajeev Syal, 2013).</p>
									<p>Another important issue is the protection from personal data breaches. As per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data breaches affect the rights and freedoms of an individual and data protection is a legal requirement. Failure in IT system makes data protection vulnerable and may lead to personal sensitive information being stolen, loss of public trust on the company and eventually lead to criminal proceedings (Claudia Glover, 2022).</p>

										<h1>Discussion 2: Legal and Ethical views on ANN applications</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Currently there is rise in use of AI writers which aids in writing documents, blogs, producing web content from the wealth of training with large number of words (Hutson, 2021). Even though it has many advantages in terms of productivity and time saving, it cannot replace human writers in creating thinking skill.</p>
									<p>Hate and antisocial texts using AI writers could be prepared and circulated through social media in no time. Regulatory controls should be put in place to monitor the content added to social media and this monitoring process should be effective to combat the speed of data sharing.</p>
									<p>Another area is the inability to evaluate the competency for creative thinking and writing. Several job applications and university applications are shortlisted based on the applicants’ expression of interest in the field. With the use of AI writers, genuine selection of appropriate candidate is very subjective.</p>
									<p>AI writers could be used as a writing assistant to create initial draft upon which the users can add in their creative content. This ability to create quick text content is highly desirable for writers but that the same time the writer’s should be held accountable and responsible for what they created and posted using the AI tools. Clear legal responsibilities should be setup in social media sites to hold the bloggers accountable for their created content. AI writers could replace humans in many fields and may result in job loss in several creative writing fronts.</p>
									<p>Care should be taken to avoid over reliant on AI tools for content generation. Limiting its use to source content suggestions, help paraphrasing short passages, check grammar and spelling and support research could be considered as advantages of using AI writers (James Hare, 2022)</p>
